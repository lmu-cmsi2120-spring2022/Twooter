Description: Twooter is a blog where users can sign in and post or read articles! These articles include a title, body, and when it was posted using JavaScript. This data is then stored in firebase. The beautiful design of different colors, images, fonts, and more are implemented using CSS. This is also where we implemented our marginas, gradients, shadows, and transitions.
